# DriveDownload
Download image files slowly

# How to Use:
- Download `fix_google_drive.exe`
- Create a new folder
- Move `fix_google_drive.exe` into the new folder
- Copy any Tabletop Simulator save file (`\Tabletop Simulator\Saves\XXX.json`) into the new folder
- Run `fix_google_drive.exe`

# Once Completed:
- You'll see in the new folder all google drive images used in the save file
- Delete the contents of the Images folder and Images Raw folder in Tabletop Simulator: (`\Tabletop Simulator\Mods\Images` and `\Tabletop Simulator\Mods\ImagesRaw`)
- Copy the image files in the new folder to the Images folder in Tabletop Simulator: (`\Tabletop Simulator\Mods\Images`)
- Run Tabletop Simulator (make sure Mod Caching is on)
- TTS should use the local files!
